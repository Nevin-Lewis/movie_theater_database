# Movie Time! Excellent!
## Description

This is a functional movie theater database where the user can view current movies and leave reviews or comments on the movies. The user is able to see a list of trending movies and sort them by genre. From there, they are able to choose a movie and view the runtime, director, and description of the movie. They can then scroll down and see a list of comments by other users. This application includes a login system to display the user's past comments and any movie recommendations as well.
